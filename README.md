# Cuisinier
Reshaping the way modern India cooks!

## What is Cuisinier?
Cuisinier is a smart platform where the app suggests the most optimum usage of the ingredients being used to prepare a particular dish. It generates a time table which maximises the number of dishes being cooked in the given amount of ingredients. It has a database consisting of more than 100+ recipes (in Beta).

We also integrated Deliciora, a system that converts a dish image to its recipe. Deliciora recognises the ingredients in a dish's image and suggests the steps you can take to cook that dish.

We also integrated Spotify playlists into our app, so that you can cook a dish while listening to great music!

## Meet Deliciora
Deliciora is a smart system where the user can click or upload the image of a dish and Deliciora suggests possible dishes and their recipes. Deliciora was built on top of Facebook's Cooking Inverse Research Paper. Deliciora recognises the ingredients in a dish's image and suggests the steps you can take to cook that dish. So the next time you think about how a particular dish would have been made, just click a photo and Deliciora would let you know!
